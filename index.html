		<h1>JavaScript performance</h1>
		<p>
			Performance can be borken down into two main categories for web
			applications, startup time and runtime performance. Startup tme is all
			about ho wlong it takes for the initalpage to load and for users tobe able
			to both see something on the screen and also interact with the page.
			Runtime performance is about how the app performs overall, are there
			freezes or lag? do animations run smoothly? are there memory leaks? Good
			performance for a web app isnt just down to the JavaScript code, you also
			have to consider your html, css and bundle size etc.
		</p>
		<h3>Measure Performance</h3>
		<p>
			When it comes to performance in JavaScript there is no point trying to
			optimize all your code straight away as it is for one impossible, two time
			consuming and three not always necessary. What you want to do is measure
			the performance of your app so you can identify the probem areas that need
			performance improvements. You want to measure performance such as
			script/bundle file sizes and HTTP roundtrips. Also always make sure you
			are measuring performance with your production ready code and not your
			development code as development code is always going to be less performant
			as it has not been built and bundled plus production is the code users are
			going to be interacting with. We can measure these things for performance
			in our app with browser devtools.
		</p>
		<h3>Browser Devtools</h3>
		<p>
			Browser Devtools allow us to measure performance. Not only can we see the
			code and measure the app performance on the browser but we can also
			simulate different devices and connection speeds to measure different
			perormance case scenarios. We can use the elements tab to see our HTML
			markup and observe structure changes and repaints/rerenders. The network
			tab lets us see all the requests we make and the files we downlaod such as
			our scripts, html, css and bundles. In the network tab we can see the file
			sizes for these downloads and also by seeing the files downlaoded we can
			determine if we are making any uneccessary extra HTTP roundtrips. We can
			also throttle and simualte slower internet connection speeds in the
			network tab to test how the startup and runtime performance on your app is
			on slower connections. We can also throttle and slow down cpu performance
			in the performance tab. We can also record performance in the performance
			tab with the record button. This allows you to record a portion of your
			interaction with the app and then see the performance results profile.
			This performance results profile will have many different graphs and data
			visualisations of the different interactions performance, this is helpful
			to see any bottle necks or performance spikes. You can zoom into potential
			spikes on the performance profile graph by simply clicking and dragging
			over the area to go into a zoomed in and more detailed look at that
			particualr areas performance. We can see things such as the call stack,
			interactions, the main thread etc. giving us the ability to deep dive into
			the performance of our code and interactions. The memory tab lets us take
			memory snapshots such as a heap snapshot showing us all JavaScript objects
			and dom nodes stored in memory, great for finding memory leaks in your
			application. We also have the audits tab which allows us to run a
			performance audit using googles lighthouse.
