		<h1>JavaScript performance</h1>
		<p>
			Performance can be borken down into two main categories for web
			applications, startup time and runtime performance. Startup tme is all
			about ho wlong it takes for the initalpage to load and for users tobe able
			to both see something on the screen and also interact with the page.
			Runtime performance is about how the app performs overall, are there
			freezes or lag? do animations run smoothly? are there memory leaks? Good
			performance for a web app isnt just down to the JavaScript code, you also
			have to consider your html, css and bundle size etc.
		</p>
		<h3>Measure Performance</h3>
		<p>
			When it comes to performance in JavaScript there is no point trying to
			optimize all your code straight away as it is for one impossible, two time
			consuming and three not always necessary. What you want to do is measure
			the performance of your app so you can identify the probem areas that need
			performance improvements. You want to measure performance such as
			script/bundle file sizes and HTTP roundtrips. Also always make sure you
			are measuring performance with your production ready code and not your
			development code as development code is always going to be less performant
			as it has not been built and bundled plus production is the code users are
			going to be interacting with. We can measure these things for performance
			in our app with browser devtools.
